# Emoji-Rater

A simple emoji rating page made with javascript and css.

The page enables users to give a rating between 1 (bad) and 5 (great), 
and then display that rating in the form of an emoji. The users should give 
their ratings by pressing a key on their keyboards (the numbers 1 to 5). 
I used event listeners, keyboard events, key codes, 
focus, focusout, DOM manipulation, tabindex
